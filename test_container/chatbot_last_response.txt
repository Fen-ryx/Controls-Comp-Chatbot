["a) **Theory:** The `solve()` function in SymPy is used to algebraically solve equations and systems of equations by finding the values of the variables that satisfy the equations.\n\nb) **Mathematical Example:**\n```python\nimport sympy as sym\n\n# Define the variables x and y\nx, y = sym.symbols('x y')\n\n# Define the equations\neq1 = x - y + 1\neq2 = x + y - 3\n\n# Solve the equations\nsolution = sym.solve((eq1, eq2))\n\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `solve()` function is used to find the values of `x` and `y` that satisfy the given equations `x - y + 1 = 0` and `x + y - 3 = 0`. The output will be `{x: 1, y: 2}`, indicating that `x = 1` and `y = 2` are the solutions to the system of equations."]
