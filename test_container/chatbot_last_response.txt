["a) Theory:\nIn control theory, the eigenvalues of a matrix play a crucial role in determining the dynamic response and stability of a system. The eigenvalues represent the poles of the system and provide information about the behavior of the system.\n\nThe eigenvalues of a matrix can be calculated using the `eigenvals` function in SymPy. This function returns a dictionary where the keys are the eigenvalues and the values are their multiplicities.\n\nb) Mathematical Example:\nLet's consider the matrix J1 from the previous example:\n```\nJ1 = Matrix([\n    [-1, 1],\n    [-1, -1]\n])\n```\n\nTo calculate the eigenvalues of J1, we can use the `eigenvals` function as follows:\n```python\nimport sympy as sym\n\nJ1 = sym.Matrix([\n    [-1, 1],\n    [-1, -1]\n])\n\neigenvalues = J1.eigenvals()\nprint(eigenvalues)\n```\n\nThe output will be:\n```\n{-1: 1, -2: 1}\n```\n\nThis means that J1 has two eigenvalues: -1 with multiplicity 1 and -2 with multiplicity 1. These eigenvalues represent the poles of the system defined by the matrix J1."]
