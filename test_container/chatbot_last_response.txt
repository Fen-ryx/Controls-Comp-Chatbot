["a) Theory:\nIn control theory, a system is described by a set of differential equations called the state equation. The state equation represents the evolution of the system's state variables over time. It is typically written in vector notation to provide a compact representation.\n\nThe state equation can be expressed as:\n\n$$\\dot{x} = f(t,x,u)$$\n\nwhere:\n- $\\dot{x}$ represents the derivative of the state vector $x$ with respect to time $t$.\n- $f(t,x,u)$ is a function that describes the dynamics of the system.\n- $u$ is the input vector that affects the system's state evolution.\n\nThe state equation is used to model various systems, such as mechanical, electrical, or biological systems. It allows us to analyze and control the behavior of these systems by designing appropriate input signals.\n\nb) Mathematical Example:\nConsider a simple pendulum system, where the state variables are the angular position $\\theta$ and the angular velocity $\\dot{\\theta}$. The input variable is the torque applied to the pendulum.\n\nThe state equation for this system can be written as:\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} \\dot{\\theta} \\\\ \\ddot{\\theta} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -\\frac{g}{L} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\theta \\\\ \\dot{\\theta} \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{mL^2} \\end{bmatrix} u$$\n\nwhere:\n- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n- $L$ is the length of the pendulum.\n- $m$ is the mass of the pendulum.\n- $u$ is the torque input.\n\nIn this example, the state vector $x$ is $\\begin{bmatrix} \\theta \\\\ \\dot{\\theta} \\end{bmatrix}$, and the input vector $u$ is simply $u$. The function $f(t,x,u)$ describes the dynamics of the pendulum system.\n\nBy analyzing the state equation, we can determine the stability and control strategies for the pendulum system. We can design appropriate inputs ($u$) to stabilize the pendulum at a desired position or track a desired trajectory."]
