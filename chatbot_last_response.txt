["a) Theory:\nIn control theory, the Jacobian matrix is a matrix of first-order partial derivatives. It is used to analyze the behavior of a system around a particular operating point, such as finding the stability of a system or determining the response of a system to small changes in its inputs. The Jacobian matrix is commonly used when dealing with systems of nonlinear equations. It provides information about the local linearization of the system around a given point. Each element of the Jacobian matrix represents the sensitivity of one equation to a change in one variable.\n\nb) Mathematical Example:\nLet's take a system of nonlinear equations:\n\nf₁ = x² + 2y\nf₂ = 3x - y\n\nTo find the Jacobian matrix for this system, we need to calculate the partial derivatives of each equation with respect to each variable:\n\n∂f₁/∂x = 2x\n∂f₁/∂y = 2\n∂f₂/∂x = 3\n∂f₂/∂y = -1\n\nThe Jacobian matrix will be:\n\nJ = [[2x, 2],\n     [3, -1]]\n\nTo find the Jacobian matrix using SymPy in Python, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sym\n\nx, y = sym.symbols('x y')\nf1 = x**2 + 2*y\nf2 = 3*x - y\n\nsystem_matrix = sym.Matrix([f1, f2])\nJ = system_matrix.jacobian([x, y])\n\nJ\n```\n\nThis will output the Jacobian matrix:\n\n[[2*x, 2],\n [3, -1]]\n\nThe Jacobian matrix provides valuable information about the behavior of the system around a specific operating point, such as stability analysis, control design, or sensitivity analysis."]
