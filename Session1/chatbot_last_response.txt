['a) **Theory:**  \nIn control theory, the "state" of a system refers to a set of variables necessary to describe the system\'s behavior at a given time. These state variables encapsulate the information needed to predict the future behavior of the system based on its current state and inputs.\n\nb) **Mathematical Example:**  \nConsider a simple mass-spring-damper system, where the state variables are the displacement $x$ and velocity $v$ of the mass. The system dynamics can be described by the following differential equations:\n$\\dot{x} = v$  \n$\\dot{v} = \\frac{1}{m}(-kx - bv + u)$\n\nHere, $x$ and $v$ are the state variables, and $u$ is the input. The state equation can be written as $\\dot{x} = f(t, x, u)$.\n\nc) **Code:**  \n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the system parameters\nm = 1.0  # Mass\nk = 2.0  # Spring constant\nb = 0.5  # Damping coefficient\n\n# Define the state matrix A\nA = np.array([[0, 1],\n              [-k/m, -b/m]])\n\n# Calculate the eigenvalues of matrix A\neigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(A)\n\nprint("Eigenvalues of the state matrix A:")\nprint(eigenvalues)\n```']
